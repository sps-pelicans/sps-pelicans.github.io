# SPS Pelicans


> Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life, we may never forget to be kind. Help us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others.

## Mission

_the fundamental purpose applicable now as well as in the future_

A platform where Saint Paul's School community members - students, staff, alums and parents - of all ages convene to have their voices heard, share thoughts, mentor each other, network with each other, etc.

Provide a single communication platform for the entire SPS community (where the SPS community = students, alums, parents, etc.) that enables members to help each other, help the SPS community, help their local community, and/or help the global community.

In terms of this project, we are not trying to directly help the disenfranchised, BIPOC, etc., we simply want to create a communication platform to support those types of initiatives.

We create a blueprint that other similar communities may replicate.


## Vision

_a descriptive picture of a desired future state_

* The community enables ongoing dialogs within and between the many constituencies
* The learning processes that occurred while an active member of the community continue become ongoing commitments
* Active members of the community - students, staff and parents - gain insights into futures outcomes by being able to access the dialogs of alum students, staff and parents
* Issues of disenfranchisement, injustice and malfeasance are identified at early stages
* The process creates lessons learned statements, identifies useful metrics and agrees useful guidelines that enhance the well-being of the entire community
* Our efforts are a model for other organizations to follow. Their feedback improves our processes


## Values

_ethics, principles,Â beliefs shared among the members of the community_

The platform is:

* free to join for all SPS community members. (question: how do we fund the initiative?
* accessible to students, alums, parents, administrators, faculty, staff associated with SPS (question: do we have limits?  Do we allow minors?)
* independent from the school. (question: how do we best partner with the school?)
* a forum that is free of bullying, hate, etc. and allows for free expression  (question: what are the rules?)
* easy to join (question: how do we make on-boarding easy)
* easy to participate, i.e. contribute/post and view posts (i.e. can do that via email?  use platform via the web?  use it via mobile device?)
* able to provide different discussion channels (everyone, public group, private group, direct messages)


## Strategies

_a roadmap or path chosen to plow towards the end vision._

As part of the vision, we also need to have a preliminary execution plan:

* Determine a value proposition for each audience (i.e. council, supes, pelicans, and beyond)
* Sell the idea to Council Members and Supes
* Have the Supes sell the idea to their organizations



## Glossary

_terms are derived from words typically used at Saint Paul's for similar functions_

### Constituencies

* "Council": 10 to 20 max - People who contribute a lot to Pelicans
* "Supervisors": 100 or so who can get the message out to the various Pelican constituencies
* "Pelicans": the 10K - members of the SPS community who are happy to receive messages and act or resound on occasion
