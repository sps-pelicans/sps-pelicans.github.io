# SPS Pelicans

## Mission

_the fundamental purpose applicable now as well as in the future_

A platform where Saint Paul's School community members - students, staff, alums and parents - of all ages convene to have their voices heard, share thoughts, mentor each other, network with each other, etc.

Provide a single communication platform for the entire SPS community (where the SPS community = students, alums, parents, etc.) that enables members to help each other, help the SPS community, help their local community, and/or help the global community.

In terms of this project, we are not trying to directly help the disenfranchised, BIPOC, etc., we simply want to create a communication platform to support those types of initiatives.

We create a blueprint that other similar communities may replicate.


## Vision

_a descriptive picture of a desired future state_

* The community enables ongoing dialogs within and between the many constituencies
* The learning processes that occurred while an active member of the community continue become ongoing commitments
* Active members of the community - students, staff and parents - gain insights into futures outcomes by being able to access the dialogs of alum students, staff and parents
* Issues of disenfranchisement, injustice and malfeasance are identified at early stages
* The process creates lessons learned statements, identifies useful metrics and agrees useful guidelines that enhance the well-being of the entire community
* Our efforts are a model for other organizations to follow. Their feedback improves our processes


## Values

_ethics, principles,Â beliefs shared among the members of the community_

The platform is:

* free to join for all SPS community members. (question: how do we fund the initiative?
* accessible to students, alums, parents, administrators, faculty, staff associated with SPS (question: do we have limits?  Do we allow minors?)
* independent from the school. (question: how do we best partner with the school?)
* a forum that is free of bullying, hate, etc. and allows for free expression  (question: what are the rules?)
* easy to join (question: how do we make on-boarding easy)
* easy to participate, i.e. contribute/post and view posts (i.e. can do that via email?  use platform via the web?  use it via mobile device?)
* able to provide different discussion channels (everyone, public group, private group, direct messages)


## Strategies

_a roadmap or path chosen to plow towards the end vision._

As part of the vision, we also need to have a preliminary execution plan:

* Determine a value proposition for each audience (i.e. council, supes, pelicans, and beyond)
* Sell the idea to Council Members and Supes
* Have the Supes sell the idea to their organizations
