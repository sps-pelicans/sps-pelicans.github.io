> Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life, we may never forget to be kind. Help us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others.

Moved to [Vision]( https://sps-pelicans.github.io/#vision.md )


## Values

_ethics, principles,Â beliefs shared among the members of the community_

The platform is:

* free to join for all SPS community members. (question: how do we fund the initiative?
* accessible to students, alums, parents, administrators, faculty, staff associated with SPS (question: do we have limits?  Do we allow minors?)
* independent from the school. (question: how do we best partner with the school?)
* a forum that is free of bullying, hate, etc. and allows for free expression  (question: what are the rules?)
* easy to join (question: how do we make on-boarding easy)
* easy to participate, i.e. contribute/post and view posts (i.e. can do that via email?  use platform via the web?  use it via mobile device?)
* able to provide different discussion channels (everyone, public group, private group, direct messages)


## Strategies

_a roadmap or path chosen to plow towards the end vision._

As part of the vision, we also need to have a preliminary execution plan:

* Determine a value proposition for each audience (i.e. council, supes, pelicans, and beyond)
* Sell the idea to Council Members and Supes
* Have the Supes sell the idea to their organizations
