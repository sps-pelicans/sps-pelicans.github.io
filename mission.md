There will always issues with student and staff where something falls between the cracks. Because intimately familiar with the School and yet being completely independent of the school the Pelicans can offer ears with less bias and and wide sensitivity.

We recognize that some students once they have attended SPS for a while may never again feel comfortable when returning to their milieu of origin. We are here to help those students create new happy places in their lives.

Mission ~ what we do now

* We moderate, curate and prioritize the best ideas and while never forgetting the fails and the lessons learned
* We help people of disparate backgrounds make decisions that bring us together

A platform where Saint Paul's School community members - students, staff, alums and parents - of all ages convene to have their voices heard, share thoughts, mentor each other, network with each other, etc.

Provide a single communication platform for the entire SPS community (where the SPS community = students, alums, parents, etc.) that enables members to help each other, help the SPS community, help their local community, and/or help the global community.

In terms of this project, we are not trying to directly help the disenfranchised, BIPOC, etc., we simply want to create a communication platform to support those types of initiatives.

We create a blueprint that other similar communities may replicate.
