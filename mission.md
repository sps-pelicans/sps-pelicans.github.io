## Test by Theo - Respose to SPS survey questions of 2020-10-13

Plans that enable the New England boarding school movement to stay alive for the next fifty years.

Plans that that help SPS set an example and are a resource that helps  education throughout the USA to ne more diverse, equitable and smarter.

Sharing successful remedies and lessons learned for helping students and staff, present and alumni that have "fallen through the cracks" in the pursuit of the objectives of the School Prayer.

Ways of building up life-long, in-your-locale associations of SPS-connected scholar-athletes

In terms of our project, my mission is simply to “connect the different members of the SPS community to be able (1) to connect with fellow community members and (2) to allow members to promote their initiatives”.  

My vision is twofold.  First, by creating this SPS-related social network, members will be able to help themselves excel, help the SPS community, help their local community, and/or help the global community.  Second, once other communities see the success of our social network, they will replicate it to help their community do the same.

There will always issues with student and staff where something falls between the cracks. Because intimately familiar with the School and yet being completely independent of the school the Pelicans can offer ears with less bias and and wide sensitivity.

We recognize that some students once they have attended SPS for a while may never again feel comfortable when returning to their milieu of origin. We are here to help those students create new happy places in their lives.

## Text mission statement on home page readme of 2020-09-13


A platform where Saint Paul's School community members - students, staff, alums and parents - of all ages convene to have their voices heard, share thoughts, mentor each other, network with each other, etc.

Provide a single communication platform for the entire SPS community (where the SPS community = students, alums, parents, etc.) that enables members to help each other, help the SPS community, help their local community, and/or help the global community.

In terms of this project, we are not trying to directly help the disenfranchised, BIPOC, etc., we simply want to create a communication platform to support those types of initiatives.

We create a blueprint that other similar communities may replicate.
