# Vision

_a descriptive picture of a desired future state_


## Text by Theo on 2020-10-11

From time to time there will be former members of the SPS community that cary a deep hate or revulsion for the experience at SPS. The Pelicans do an excellent jon of contacting and stating in touch with these people. The histories and lessons learned are recorded and shared.
