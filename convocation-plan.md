# Convocation plan

## First period

People: Jose Theo

Communication: email personal & groups.io

Mission: build up text for mission, vision and values

Documents: kept wherever handy


## Second period

Actions:

* Jose invite Marcy, Ben and friends
* Theo invites Alexis and Lent
* Any others? Say ten max for the time being.

Mission: Establish a "Council"

Update and reach agreement on Mission & Vision with the new Council members


## Third period

Mission: Agree a strategy

Actions:

Discuss with Council the best ways to contact and bring aboard, say, up to 50 to 80 key players as the "Supes" including all the class reps, relevant members of the various unions represented at the school and so on.

First we will need to identify and create a list of prospects. Then we will have to invite them. This may well have to happen one by one.


## Fourth period

Mission: Establish a cohort of "Supes"

Each member of the Supes group will have their own idiosyncratic way of communicating with their various cohorts - ranging from Zoom to fax, from SnapChat to Apple Messenger to whatever.

Our job as the techs will be to establish a viable system of two way communication between all the Council and the Supes.

Thinking out loud: Mastodon may offer some great possibilities for making effective two-way dialog happen. I've looked at the source code and it looks like being very easy to customize and extend. More about this in a later post.


## Fifth period

Mission: Initiate contact with "Pelicans"

Once we have a reasonable dialog established with the "Supes", the Council supports the Supes in bringing on board as many "pelicans" as possible.

Assuming that must of the Supes mostly communicate with their cohorts using the system we have set up for the Supes, the process of going from 50 to 5,000 should be primarily about bugs and bandwidth.


## XX period

Mission: The "vision" happens
